# sfdx-jenkins-org

For a fully guided walkthrough of setting up and configuring continuous integration using scratch orgs and Salesforce CLI, see the [Continuous Integration Using Salesforce DX](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/sfdx_travis_ci) Trailhead module.

This repository shows how to successfully setup deploying to non-scratch orgs (sandbox or production) with Jenkins. We make a few assumptions in this README. Continue only if you have completed these critical configuration prerequisites.

- You know how to set up your repository with Jenkins. (Need help? See the [Getting Started guide](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/).)

- You have properly set up the JWT-based authorization flow (headless). We recommended using [these steps for generating your self-signed SSL certificate](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self).

## Getting Started
1) [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) this repo in to your GitHub account using the fork link at the top of the page.

2) Clone your forked repo locally: `git clone https://github.com/<git_username>/sfdx-jenkins-org.git`

3) Make sure that you have the Salesforce CLI installed. Run `sfdx force --help` and confirm you see the command output. If you don't have it installed, you can download and install it from [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli).

4) Set up a [custom tool](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Custom+Tools+Plugin) in Jenkins for Salesforce CLI. Name the custom tool `toolbelt` and set its installation directory to the path where the `sfdx` executable is (for example, `/usr/local/bin/sfdx`).

5) Set up a JWT-based auth flow for the target orgs that you want to deploy to. This step creates a `server.key` file that is used in subsequent steps.
(https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_jwt_flow.htm)

6) Confirm that you can perform a JWT-based auth to the target orgs: `sfdx force:auth:jwt:grant --clientid <your_consumer_key> --jwtkeyfile server.key --username <your_username>`

   **Note:** For more info on setting up JWT-based auth, see [Authorize an Org Using the JWT-Based Flow](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_jwt_flow.htm) in the [Salesforce DX Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev).

7) From your JWT-based connected app on Salesforce, retrieve the generated `Consumer Key`.

8) Set up Jenkins [global environment variables](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Global+Variable+String+Parameter+Plugin) for your Salesforce `Consumer Key` and `Username`. Note that this username is the username that you use to access your Salesforce org.

    Create an environment variable named `SF_CONSUMER_KEY`.

    Create an environment variable named `SF_USERNAME`.

9) Store the generated `server.key` file as a Jenkins secret file using the [Jenkins Admin Credentials interface](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Binding+Plugin). Make note of the new entryâ€™s ID.

10) Set up Jenkins [global environment variable](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Global+Variable+String+Parameter+Plugin) to store the ID of the secret file you created.

    Create an environment variable named `SERVER_KEY_CREDENTIALS_ID`.

11) Create a Jenkins pipeline with the `Jenkinsfile` included in the root directory of the Git repository.

Now you're ready to go! When you commit and push a change, your change kicks off a Jenkins build.

Enjoy!
